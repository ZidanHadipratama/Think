To evaluate which religious tradition exhibits the least internal doctrinal contradiction from a historical-textual consistency perspective, while ignoring metaphysical truth claims, we must establish clear criteria:

**Assumptions:**

1. **"Historical-textual consistency"**: This refers to the coherence and stability of a tradition's foundational texts over time, and how consistently its core doctrines have been articulated and maintained across its historical development. It implies examining the degree to which later textual or doctrinal developments either align with or diverge from earlier ones.

2. **"Least internal doctrinal contradiction"**: This means the system of beliefs, as expressed in its canonical texts and subsequent authoritative interpretations, demonstrates minimal logical inconsistencies or mutually exclusive tenets. It does not imply an an absence of debate or varying interpretations, but rather a system where core principles do not fundamentally undermine each other.

3. **"Ignoring metaphysical truth claims"**: This means we are not assessing whether the claims about God, gods, ultimate reality, or the afterlife are "true" in an absolute sense, but rather how consistently these claims (whatever they may be) are presented within the tradition's own framework.

**Analysis:**

Several traditions present strong cases for internal consistency, but they achieve this through different mechanisms.

1. **Confucianism:** Primarily an ethical and philosophical system, its core texts (e.g., the Analects) present a remarkably consistent framework for moral conduct, social harmony, and good governance. Its consistency largely stems from its practical focus and relatively limited engagement with complex metaphysical or cosmological doctrines, which are often sources of potential contradiction in other traditions. The historical transmission of its core ideas has been stable.

2. **Jainism:** This tradition emphasizes a highly systematic philosophy, ethics, and cosmology. Its core tenets, such as *Ahimsa* (non-violence), *Anekantavada* (non-absolutism or many-sidedness), and *Syadvada* (conditioned predication), are deeply interwoven and consistently applied. *Anekantavada*, in particular, is a philosophical doctrine that explicitly addresses the multi-faceted nature of reality, asserting that truth is relative to various perspectives and that absolute statements are inherently flawed. This doctrine serves as an internal mechanism to prevent dogmatism and reconcile apparent contradictions by acknowledging the partial validity of different viewpoints, thereby fostering internal consistency within its own framework. While there are sectarian differences (e.g., Digambara and Svetambara), these primarily concern monastic practices and scriptural canon rather than fundamental doctrinal contradictions regarding the nature of the soul, karma, or the path to liberation.

3. **Islam:** The Quran, as the central text, is considered by adherents to be the direct and uncorrupted word of God, revealed over a relatively short period. Its singular origin and the belief in its divine preservation contribute to a strong sense of textual consistency. The doctrine of *nasikh wa mansukh* (abrogation), where later verses are understood to supersede earlier ones in specific contexts, is a theological mechanism within Islam to address apparent textual contradictions, ensuring the internal coherence of the divine message. However, the vast body of Hadith literature and the subsequent development of diverse schools of Islamic law and theology have led to extensive debates and varying interpretations, sometimes presenting interpretive challenges to consistency.

**Trade-offs:**

* **Confucianism's** consistency benefits from its narrower scope, focusing more on ethics and social order than intricate metaphysics. This limits the potential points of contradiction but also means it doesn't grapple with certain types of complex theological or cosmological questions that might introduce contradiction in other traditions.

* **Jainism's** consistency is achieved not just by a stable textual tradition but also by a sophisticated philosophical doctrine (*Anekantavada*) that actively integrates multiple perspectives without resorting to contradiction. This demonstrates a robust internal system for managing complexity.

* **Islam's** consistency is bolstered by the singular authority of the Quran and the doctrine of abrogation, which provides a framework for resolving apparent textual discrepancies. However, the sheer volume of secondary texts (Hadith) and the historical development of diverse interpretive schools introduce significant complexity and potential for differing doctrinal conclusions.

**Conclusion:**

Under the specified assumptions, **Jainism** exhibits the least internal doctrinal contradiction. Its strength lies not only in a relatively stable and compact textual tradition but, more critically, in its explicit philosophical doctrine of *Anekantavada* (non-absolutism). This core doctrine functions as an inherent, sophisticated mechanism to understand reality as multi-faceted, thereby actively preventing and resolving potential contradictions by integrating diverse perspectives rather than rejecting them. This systematic approach to truth, embedded within its core teachings, provides a high degree of internal coherence that is actively maintained within its doctrinal framework.
